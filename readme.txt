This is a prototype of my cloud-based product, where users have the opportunity to create their architectural designs within a designated playground. Once their design is ready, they can simply click the deploy button to implement it on their accounts.


Used Reactflow for front-end
PHP files in the back-end to trigger the Python files which will generate terraform code based on the design and deploy them.
